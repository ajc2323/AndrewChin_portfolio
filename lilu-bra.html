      <p>
        Lilu Inc. is a small startup which aims to innovation and revolutionize the maternal healthcare space, specifically with respect to breastfeeding and pumping health and care. 
        I have been working at Lilu Inc. for the past year and a half where I began as an Engineering Intern and am now the Lead Product Engineer. I have contributed to the development of
        Lilu Inc.'s smart bra and wearable breast pump, leading the team with my expertise in rapid prototyping, CAD expertise (most notably in SolidWorks), and electro-mechanical planning and assembly.

      <p>
        As an Engineering Intern at Lilu Inc., I worked on the early-stage development of a Smart Sensing Bra system intended to detect pressure and strain signals during lactation.
        Through extensive research I identified potential flexible and fabric pressure and strain sensors. To characterize the performance of these sensors, I designed custom test jigs 
        to test accuracy, repeatability, and sensitivity.

      <h3 id="wearable-breast-pump">Wearable Breast Pump Contributions - Engineering Intern & Lead Product Engineer</h3>
      <p>
        As the Engineering Intern at Lilu Inc., I worked on the early-stage development of our wearable breast pump including the following tasks:
        <ul>
          <li>Worked closely with the Industrial Designer to Translate Rhino CAD designs into SolidWorks. I also implemented engineering tolerances for FDM and SLA printing and overall design for manufacturing requirements.</li>
          <li>Met consistently with the CEO, Industrial Designer, and Biomedical Engineer to develop concepts and designs to best solve the breastfeeding and pumping needs of mothers.</li>
          <li>3D printed prototype parts via FDM and SLA to assess overall form factor, aesthetics and functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        
        As the Lead Product Engineer at Lilu Inc., I have spearheaded and oversaw the development of our prototype from initial design concepts to a fully functioning Alpha prototype that has undergone beta and pilot testing with moms in the field.
        As part of this journey I:
        <ul>
          <li>Lead the development and iterative design process.</li>
          <li>Conduct validation and verification testing.</li>
          <li>Oversee operations with our manufacturers in China and the US.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="strain-jig">Strain Jig Design & Protocol</h3>

      <p>
        To evaluate strain sensor performance, I designed a custom jig where one end of the sensor was zip-tied to a fixed metal base and the other to the retractable piston of a linear actuator. 
        Care was taken to ensure the sensor remained taut without pre-strain. The linear actuator, powered and controlled by an Arduino Uno and motor driver, retracted at a constant 10 mm/s, elongating the sensor over time. 
        A simple voltage divider circuit enabled real-time voltage readings across the sensor, captured via the Arduino analog pin and converted from raw values to voltages within the sketch. Simultaneously, elongation was 
        calculated based on elapsed time and actuator velocity, providing a continuous mapping of strain to output voltage. Both datasets were logged in tandem for downstream analysis.

        <h3 id="pressure-jig">Pressure Jig Design & Protocol</h3>

        <p>
          To characterize pressure sensor performance, I developed a custom test jig featuring a linear actuator, syringe, and water receptacle to apply a controlled compressive load. 
          As the actuator extends, water is displaced from the syringe into the receptacle, exerting a load on the pressure sensor; retraction removes the load. A load cell placed beneath the 
          sensor serves as a ground truth reference, capturing the actual force applied. Using an Arduino Uno, I controlled the actuator’s motion and simultaneously logged real-time load cell 
          data and pressure sensor voltage outputs. This setup enabled continuous cycling and synchronized data collection for downstream analysis.
