        CompostSmart is designed to bring personalized information for your compost bins. Our bin and app empower volunteers by identifying optimal compost materials, 
        monitoring essential metrics for compost health, and creating a network for gardeners to exchange tips on maintaining healthy bins.

      <h2 id="problem">Problem Identification</h2>
      <p>Composting is key for maintaining a sustainable garden, yet busy NYC community gardeners struggle with compost pile optimization. 
        Composting is important but it seems like nobody knows how to do it right. There are google groups that share information, 
        but they are disorganized and lacks specifics. Evenmore, knowledgeable gardeners do not have the right bin to compost efficiently.

      <p>We built a the CompostSmart prototype within Figma to showcase its 3 main features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Compost Material Identification & Education</li>
        <li>Compost Health Monitoring</li>
        <li>Community Garden Information and Resource Sharing Network</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="bubble compostsmart-layout">
        <h3 id="social">Information & Resource Sharing Network</h3>
        <p>
          CompostSmart serves as a central hub for the collective knowledge of New York City community gardeners.
          Users can find resources on common issues, interests and even learning how to start gardening and get 
          involved in their local community. If they need to find specifics they can search through other users' posts
          pose their own questions and successes others with a surplus of knowledge.

        <h3 id="scanning">Compost Material Identification & Education</h3>
        <p>
          Within the community gardens, many individuals, ranging from beginners to the seasoned veterans,
          struggle with composting the right materials. CompostSmart allows users to easily sort through their garbage 
          and find the compostable materials. Once identified, user can also learn how each component 
          contributes to the optimal health of their compost.

      <div class="bubble">
        <h3 id="monitor">Compost Health Monitoring</h3>
        <p>
          Continuous monitoring of a compost bin is vital 
          to ensure the production of healthy compost. New York 
          community gardeners, however, are often extremely busy 
          and thus unable to check their compost in person.
        </p>
        <p>
          To solve this issue, the CompostSmart app comes with a sensor kit to convert any bin into a smart bin.
          Paired with the app, the sensors monitor the filled capacity, humidity, and temperature, 
          providing an overall health score for community gardeners. A motion detector feature even allows
          users check if there are rats burrowing inside compost (one of the biggest issues they face). 
          This enables community gardeners to check on their compost asynchronously at anytime during the day.
