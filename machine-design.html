      <p>
        For this Machine Design project, I, along with a team of 4 other students, designed and built an arcade button-pressing mechanism capable of rapidly and accurately targeting 
        multiple buttons using a single motor. This involved developing a low-inertia linkage system in SolidWorks, optimizing speed and 
        torque through an inertia-matched transmission, and integrating sensors with closed-loop PID control on an Arduino to ensure precise 
        positioning. We fabricated components in the machine shop, assembled the device to meet tight tolerances, and implemented safety 
        features such as limit switches and hard stops. Through iterative testing and optimization, we refined the mechanism to achieve 
        reliable, high-speed performance under competition conditions.

      <p>
        Below is the board to which our mechanism would mount. Note that the button placement and mounting holes for our mechanism served as the main constraints for our design.
        The button locations were used to determine and calculate optimal transmission angles for our mechanism which served as the foundation for our design.

      </div>

      <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Machine Design Requirement:</strong> The device must press the buttons as many times as possible in 1 minute using 
                a DC motor in a PID controlled system. The red, blue and yellow buttons must be pressed with the provided acrylic actuator 
                piece.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Score Requirement:</strong> The performance score is designed as the number of points accumulated at the end of the round. 
            Points are awarded when a button is successfully pressed. The score should be maximized.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Constraint:</strong> Teams are provided with a kit of specified materials. Each team has a budget of $100 to source their transmission and button actuation devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission Angle Constraint:</strong> The transmission angle deviation from the ideal transmission angle of 90 degrees must not exceed 60 degrees.</li>
            <li><strong>Volume Constraint:</strong> The mechanism should be as small as possible. The smallest rectangular box that encases 
                your device must not exceed 15,000 cubic inches.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Requirement:</strong> The mechanism must be safe, with all sharp edges filleted; threads on bolts should not protrude more than 1.5 times their diameter.</li>
            <li><strong>Craftsmanship Constraint:</strong> The mechanism must be well machined with a good surface finish and be aesthetically pleasing.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        Utilizing SolidWorks, I constructed a 2-D layout of the 4-bar linkage mechanism that would be able to press the 3 button pairs. I engaged in an iterative design 
        process optimizing transmission angles, ground pivot points, and coupler geometry.

      <p>
        The transmission angle design was used to inform the length of our linkages, the ground pivot locations and coupler geometry. The full assembly of our mechanism was modeled within SolidWorks including the 
        DC motor, shoulder bolts, sleeve and oil bearings, linkages, ground pivots, hard stops, transmission timing belt gears, and solenoid.

        <h3>Linkages</h3>

        <p>
            The linkage geometry was designed and modeled within SolidWorks. The design was optimized for structural stability 
            and the minimization of weight. This is seen by the trusses built into the interior of the links which maintain the integrity of the part while 
            removing mass. Note that FEA was conducted on the linkages factoring in the worst case loading. These parts were machined from the provided aluminum sheet 
            using a Waterjet and CNC Mill.

        <h3>Coupler</h3>

        <p>
          The coupler was designed in SolidWorks to hold our solenoid button actuator and the provided acrylic button presser.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          The coupler was 3D printed with PLA due to its complex geometry. This also worked to significantly reduced its weight when compared to aluminum alloy. 
          The solenoid was fixed in place with mounting screws. The acrylic button presser was mounted to the solenoid via a press fit and stabilized with two thin steel rods.

      <h2 id="testing-results">Testing & Results</h2>
      <p>
        The machine was tested under multiple load and speed conditions to validate its performance. 
        Testing confirmed the mechanism met the required criteria, achieving [insert performance metric, e.g., 
        smooth operation at desired speeds, target force output, or successful task completion].

      <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        This project reinforced skills in CAD, FEA, mechanical system integration, and iterative prototyping. 
        Additionally, it highlighted the importance of precise tolerances, material selection, and teamwork in 
        achieving a functional and reliable design.
